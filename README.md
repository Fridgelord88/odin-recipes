This project was the second website I coded using HTML. The things I learned
in this project was how to create absolute and relative links, as well as putting 
images in my website. The first challenge was using git and creating messages, I undrestand
how to push to git now, but my messages still need work. I also learned to double check my code
since one of the links I created did not work because I forgot to put the text in the anchor
element.
